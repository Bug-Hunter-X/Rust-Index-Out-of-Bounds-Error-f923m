This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates an index out of bounds error and its solution. The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code that attempts to access an element beyond the vector's bounds. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential error using the `get()` method and a match statement to check for valid indices, preventing a panic at runtime.
